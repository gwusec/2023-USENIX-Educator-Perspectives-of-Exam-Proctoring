R_SZEy3bxuQafYPAt,Most digital tools have some level of privacy issues. Any program that can access an internal mic or video seems to be a privacy risk.

R_2ByvQ4CrDcGDzV8,"Any program that requires you to download a file, disables your system functionality, and automatically searches your computer for files to upload is a total invasion of privacy. Additionally, the proctoring service records the student at their most vulnerable- in their home environment where they sometimes forget they are being recorded.

R_1GJ4fI4ldXCLjOI,"We frequently use Zoom (or similar tools) for all kinds of meetings, and most people appreciate the convenience of being able to do so. I don't perceive an exam scenario as having different privacy concerns than any other use of such virtual conferencing tools.",,,,,,,,
