I do not believe that online monitoring is very good. A better strategy is to create assessments that work because Internet searches and canned or saved answers will be fruitless.,"""I am very concerned about valid and reliable foreign-language testing. The challenge before me was to create valid and reliable tests that were also cheat-proof. We had to deploy the tests across our Russian language program. That's about 70 students. In the lower-division courses, that involves testing a lot of material acquired through contextualized memorization. We met that challenge by creating tasks that were not googleable. These included dictation, unrestricted cloze activities, and short answers to unpredictable prompts. Students had to write their answers out by hand and photograph their work to submit it. Handwriting is normally how we do tests face-to-face; all Russians handwrite script. That way of doing things made forays to cut and paste from Google unmanageable. Now, were the tests that we came up with reliable? Any new test is sure to have reliability problems. We compared Covid test results with results from similar classes in the past. For students with long track records in our courses, we were able to compare their current performance with previous performance. Finally, we compared written work to oral work. Face-to-face oral work is extremely hard to cheat on. We found that the covid test results correlated well with all those measures, except the speaking results. To our amazement the results on Oral Proficiency Interviews (OPI) for all levels but first year were significantly better than in previous years. We are at a loss to explain that. But we are not complaining. And you can’t cheat on a live OPI. It’s all too obvious when people are reading off the screen. And a slightly unexpected question does the cheater in. That was not the case with this contingent of students.""",Extremely unlikely,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
