The challenge before me was to create valid and reliable tests that were also cheat-proof. We had to deploy the tests across our Russian language program. That's about 70 students. In the lower-division courses, that involves testing a lot of material acquired through contextualized memorization. We met that challenge by creating tasks that were not googleable. These included dictation, unrestricted cloze activities, and short answers to unpredictable prompts. Students had to write their answers out by hand and photograph their work to submit it. Handwriting is normally how we do tests face-to-face; all Russians handwrite script. That way of doing things made forays to cut and paste from Google unmanageable. Now, were the tests that we came up with reliable? Any new test is sure to have reliability problems. We compared Covid test results with results from similar classes in the past. For students with long track records in our courses, we were able to compare their current performance with previous performance. Finally, we compared written work to oral work. Face-to-face oral work is extremely hard to cheat on. We found that the covid test results correlated well with all those measures, except the speaking results. To our amazement the results on Oral Proficiency Interviews (OPI) for all levels but first year were significantly better than in previous years. We are at a loss to explain that.

R_24Bl50GG9gnxnww,No,,I don't give exams.,"The majority of the assignments I give require students to read scientific articles and then respond to very specific questions about the methodology and findings of those articles. This involves more than just retrieving concepts from memory -- they have to apply what they've learned in class to what they've read in the articles and then articulate their thoughts in writing. So, the answers to the assignment questions aren't sitting out there on the internet for them to just copy/paste. If they don't do the reading, they won't be able to respond to the questions. They are told that they are free to discuss the articles and assignments with each other (I actually encourage that), but that they actual writing has to come from each of them individually. It is always quite obvious that they are NOT all copy/pasting and submitting the same text.",Neither likely nor unlikely
R_2YMvWaESi0rZX5E,No,,I don't believe we should be using these tools. I think it's an infringement on a student's privacy and there is room for error in determining that a student did something wrong.

It seemed to me that it would require a bigger time investment on my part than I was interested in making for a one time use. (2) From what i read about remote proctoring, it sounded like students might feel that I distrusted them, that their living space and family's privacy was invaded, and that they were subject to an uncomfortable level of surveillance. Given the stress, anxiety, and mental health issues many students were already reporting, I was reluctant to add this. At the beginning of the semester, I did ask students if they have had any experiece in other classes with remote proctoring that they would share with me but I received no responses.""","""Quizzes: Only count for a couple points which I made totally into extra credit.

The technology worked fine but I advised students that I wasn't totally confident in the technology (I read not to rely on it for quizzes) and that if recording results didn't work for some reason, I would provide an alternative extra credit mechanism. The zoom polls worked fine. I did not care if some students were able to look up their answer in the brief time provided -- it is unlikely that would help unless they had done the reading and made some notes which is what I was trying to encourage.
