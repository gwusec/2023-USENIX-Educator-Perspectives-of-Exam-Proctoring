R_1IQQnYLDAqQoVUI,"""If live proctoring is conducted via Zoom (that's my back-up when respondus fails), then having student see that an actual person is there looking over there shoulder emulates the in person exam experience to deter any funny business. Webcam recording, lockdown browser and facial detection is done standard on respondus to allow instructors to check for potential violation after the exam is complete. Lockdown browser is definitely key, I don't want student googling around. Facial detection not as necessary I don't turn on the option for respondus to fire off warnings when students face disappear from view, but I do watch the recordings later to determine if there is any egregious violations.""",self_proctoring,self_proctoring->zoom,unchanged->webcam,unchanged->lockdown_browser,unchanged->lockdown_browser->useful_for_resource_restriction,remove_monitoring,remove_monitoring->face_detection,remove_monitoring->face_detection->too_many_warnings
