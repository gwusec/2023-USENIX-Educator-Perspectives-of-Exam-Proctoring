# Qualitative coding data files in CSV format
This folder contains coded responses to the free-response questions in the survey.
 
For submitted responses (i.e., rows with non-blank entries in the second row),
there will be one or more codes from the primary and secondary coders. Codes
are in the columns headed with `Code 1`, `Code 2`, etc. 

Some codes have sub-codes to specify further details, such as
`permissions->correct` to denote checking that permissions are correct.Any
row containing sub-codes will also have the top-level code (such as
`permissions`) in another column.
