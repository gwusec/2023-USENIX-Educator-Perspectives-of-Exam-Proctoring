# Qualitative analysis
This folder contains irr.py script used to calculate the inter-rater reliability (Cohen's Kappa), and a shell script runirr.sh that will run the irr.py program on each of the qualitative coding csv files both primary and secondary. 
Input data files can be found in `2023-USENIX-Educator-Perspectives-of-Exam-Proctoring/data/qualitative_data/irr_inputs`.

Duplicates of the input files are also located in the input\_data folder.

```
% ./runirr.sh
```
